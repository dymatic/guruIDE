          <h3>Welcome to the Guru Integrated Development Environment!</h3>

<p>Some have argued that this program is not a true IDE. In its current state, I would agree that it barely qualifies for the title. However, the program is capable of generated code that the user did not create, so in that sense it is an IDE.</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>June 24th, 2012 - Guru 1 released. Page, wiki, etc. made
June 25th, 2012 - Guru 1.5 released. Integration with SCT now present.</p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>

<p>I welcome contributions to this IDE. If you want to help you can clean up my source a bit, implement <a href="https://github.com/dymatic/guruIDE/wiki/Guru-plan-outline">these</a> changes, or write tutorials / documentation for me. Crash testers are also welcome.</p>

<p>I am also in dire need of artwork for my program. My current artwork is located in my <a href="https://github.com/dymatic/guruIDE/tree/master/gDeb/usr/share/pixmaps/guru">project here</a>. I made all of these icons in GIMP and they just look a little bit too... Cartoonish.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>I offer 1-on-1 support for guru here: <a href="mailto:kzzear@hotmail.com">email</a>. You can also stop by my blog or IRC and leave a message regarding your problem. If the program is crashing, tell me what you were doing when it happened. If the problem is a button not doing anything (common) let me know which one it is and I will wire the connection. Graphical problems are on your end and may be caused by your Qt theme. I wrote all of my interfaces with the Lucidity GTK theme in mind.</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p>About a year ago I gave up on a project called Laside. Thanks, former self!</p>

<h3>Getting Guru IDE</h3>

<p>Guru IDE is free software. Return to the code section and you will notice a .deb file. The .deb is a file installable on any debian-based system. The word "ubuntu" in the file name is just to keep track of what it was designed for. This will work on both Debian and Ubuntu as long as the dependencies are met. There is also a .rpm package for Fedora, Red-Hat, Opensuse, Mageia, mandriva, and any related system.</p>

<p>If you are NOT on a Debian system but still on Linux you can go into gDeb/usr/bin and download the executable. You will not be given any Window icons with this option.</p>
