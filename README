This is a program used to graphically create programs. You can either compile it from the source or use the .deb I attached. Inside gDeb you will find the resources associated with this program, including the icons.

On windows systems the icons will not work because they rely on /usr/share/pixmaps/guru. You can change this in the source if you wish. The executable is in gDeb/usr/bin if you just want to run it from there, but remember that there will be no window icons.

This project is still in heavy development. Here are a list of the future additions I will make to the program:

===Developer Plans===
Better aesthetics
SCT integration (this is one of my higher priorities)
Syntax highlighting (so is this)
About dialog
Help dialog
More control in the loop dialog.

===History===
About a year ago I made a program in Java and Swing called "Laside" that did the same thing that this program does. However, I did not fully understand programming at the time and was unable
to have communication across multiple windows. I gave up. Almost exactly a year later I began
development on Laside 2 using Qt. After a week it was finished, and I released it under the codename "Guru 1".
